# Hyprland Dots
Here you will find the hyprland configuration I use on my laptop which is running Arch. This is just a fun little project for me to do on the side since I enjoy the idea that I can make this computer work and feel in exactly the way I like. I do not do any sort of coding professionally; configuring these files is just something I enjoy doing and learning about. 

With that said, since I am a novice, I did have some help from the Internet. I followed the Arch Wiki for the initial installation, then I tried a bunch of other people's dotfiles and tried to understand how they work. I made a list of necessary and quality of life programs, and following that, I reinstalled Arch with all the programs I had listed. From there I tried to edit config files by myself, but I did base some of my configs off some other dotfile templates that I found floating around. Most things are based on the default configuration files of the programs I am using; nothing is taken directly from someone else's configuration except the [swaylock](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-v2.1/blob/main/config/hypr/swaylock/config) config. Even for that, however, I think I changed the time format. 

All in all, I'm very happy with the way my system has turned out, and I think that using git is a nice way to keep track of changes I make to my system, and it can even act as a backup in case I need to reinstall Arch on this machine or any other machine for any reason whatsoever. Feel free to use my config as is or as a base for your own config. Let me know if there are any ways it might be improved.
